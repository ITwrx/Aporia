==========================

This is a hot fix release which fixes compilation on case sensitive file
systems.

08/06/2016 - Version 0.4.0
==========================

This release has been long overdue. It may surprise you to see the high jump
in version number, this is because the Nim installer bundled a "fake"
version 0.3.0 up until now.

There are many changes between the last release and this one. Some of them
are outlined below. A big change for this release is the inclusion of an icon
and a Mac OS X build.

* Tabs can now be reordered.
* Close button can now only be shown on the selected tab. (This is configurable)
* Error list.
* Many bug fixes for handling of processes.
* Aporia is now a single instance application. This means you can easily
  open documents from the file manager and it will open in the same aporia window.
  (Compile with ``-d:noSingleInstance`` to disable this behaviour)
* Scrolling when restoring a session **finally** works.
* Added 'piekno' and 'yumbum' (Created by fowl) color schemes.
* 'piekno' is now the default color scheme.
* Pragmas can now be colored using the "nimrod:pragma" style name.
* Whole blocks and lines of code can now be commented using Ctrl + /.
* Tabs and two consecutive underscores are now highlighted as errors when using
the Nimrod syntax highlighter.
* Recent file list in File menu.
* Fixed a bug where double clicking on the tabs/scrollbar caused a new tab to
  be opened.
* Opening documents which are non-utf8 now works, aporia prompts the user for
  the encoding.
* Improved status bar; when text is selected the status bar now reports the
  amount of lines/characters that are selected.
* Fixed a bug where Save As did not properly change the syntax highlighting of
  the file.
* Syntax highlighting can now be changed by going to View -> Syntax Highlighting.
* Aporia's config file can now be opened in Aporia easily through the Edit menu.
* Suggest and Go to definition is now executed asynchronously.
* Fixed a bug where Style insensitive search does not find tabulators.
* Fixed a bug where searching backwards may skip to the end of the file instead
  of matching a term at the top of the file.
* When searching, all occurrences in the document of your search will now be
  highlighted.
* When you select text all occurrences of the selected text will now be highlighted.
* You are now notified when search wraps around the end of the file through the
  status bar.
* Compiling an unsaved file now saves it to /tmp. Aporia will warn you about any
  files which are saved in /tmp with a red ``*``. Old behaviour can be restored
  by changing the ``compileUnsavedSave`` option in the config, more info in
  SettingsDoc.markdown.
* Tooltip improvements: tab's language is displayed as well as other information.
* Settings are now seperated into two files: config.global.ini and config.auto.ini.
  The latter contains settings which should not be edited as they might be overwritten
  when Aporia is closed (last session info, window width/height etc.). The former
  can be edited.
